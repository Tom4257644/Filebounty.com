This is an idea I really love and wish I had the time to fully commit to. The concept is that anyone can post a 'bounty' for some kind of small internet-based task they need done—like creating a JSON file in a specific format or fixing a corrupted file. One of the 'bounty hunters' then comes along, does the work, and 'claims the bounty'.

Very simple concept—a sort of lower-stakes freelance job website where jobs are open on a first-come, first-served basis, and there is no commitment required from the person offering the work.

This idea stems from the availability of knowledge and computers in third-world or lower-income countries, but a lack of employment opportunities. The hope is that those working high-paying tech jobs might be willing to give away something like $4 USD for 60 minutes of someone else's work on a 'bounty' they posted, because they get paid something like $100 USD an hour—thus benefiting both parties.

In reality, there are numerous challenges: how to handle exchanges of funding, how to drive traffic from both sides, and not to mention, difficult legal hurdles.

The project is currently not live as server fees get expensive for unused projects.
