This is an idea I really love and wish I had the time to fully commit to. The concept is that anyone can post a 'bounty' for some kind of small internet-based task they need done—like creating a JSON file in a specific format or fixing a corrupted file. One of the 'bounty hunters' then comes along, does the work, and 'claims the bounty'.

Very simple concept—a sort of lower-stakes freelance job website where jobs are open on a first-come, first-served basis, and there is no commitment required from the person offering the work.

This idea stems from the availability of knowledge and computers in third-world or lower-income countries, but a lack of employment opportunities. The hope is that those working high-paying tech jobs might be willing to give away 60 minutes of their time for something like $4 USD—because they might get paid $100 USD an hour—thus benefiting both parties.

In reality, there are numerous challenges: how to handle exchanges of funding, how to drive traffic from both sides, and not to mention, difficult legal hurdles.

The project is currently live, but not used so there are unlikely to be any live bounties, if you want to see them I recommend posting some with the provided account.
